Advanced React in Hooks course. I train my React skills developping a Speed Typing game. I follow the challenges in Scrimba Learning.\
In addition, I bootstraped my project to use Typescript.\

# The game

It's a game when you have a few seconds to type as much words as you can.\
You have to roll each dice until all dice are the same.\
You have to click on each dice between each roll in order to freeze it at its current value.

# Methodology

The steps are the following :

✅ Initialization\
✅ Use a state for the TextArea\
✅ Compute the word count\
✅ Countdown timer\
✅ Launch the countdown timer when clicking the button\
✅ Adding the wordCount\
✅ UseRef in order to focus the TextArea when clicking the Start Button\
✅ Refactor with Custom Hook\

After following the course with Scrimba, I :
